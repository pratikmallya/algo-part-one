How to Run
----------
If you don't use an IDE like me, it takes a little bit more effort to run the
code from the command line. This is how you do it:

```
javac -cp algs4.jar Percolation.java
java -cp .:algs4.jar Percolation
```

where `algs4.jar` is the jar library provided by the course.

To zip the files before submission:

```
zip -r percolation.zip Percolation.java PercolationStats.java
```
